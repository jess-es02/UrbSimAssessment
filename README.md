# UrbSimAssessment

This coursework was conducted entirely using Google Colab and the GitHub website, as I did not have access to a laptop or any local software during the project. It looks like you can only push Colab notebooks to a public repo, so there aren't many commits on this repo: I simply conducted all my analysis on Colab, pushed to a public repo once the project was finished, and immediately turned the repo private.

This also explains why the data isn't more organised on the repo: I encountered challenges in uploading the data in folders, so had to push them as individual files. Apologies for the slightly disorganised repo, but the analysis should hopefully be unaffected!
